# MechvibesDX üöÄ

**Transform your typing into a symphony of mechanical keyboard sounds!**

Ever missed the satisfying *click-clack* of a mechanical keyboard? I've been there too. That's why I created MechvibesDX - to bring back those beautiful keyboard sounds to any setup, whether you're using a membrane keyboard, working late at night, or just want to add some personality to your typing experience.

## Why I Built This üí≠

As a developer who spends countless hours typing, I found myself missing the tactile feedback and satisfying sounds of mechanical keyboards. Sometimes you can't use a loud mechanical keyboard (late night coding sessions, anyone?), but you still want that satisfying audio feedback that makes typing feel... *right*.

MechvibesDX is my love letter to mechanical keyboards - a way to bring those authentic sounds to everyone, regardless of their actual keyboard hardware.

## What Makes It Special ‚ú®

### üéµ **Authentic Sound Experience**
- **Every keystroke matters** - Hear realistic mechanical keyboard sounds as you type
- **Mouse clicks too** - Because why should keyboards have all the fun?
- **Perfect timing** - Sounds that respond to both key presses AND releases
- **Volume control** - Adjust keyboard and mouse sounds independently

### üé® **Beautiful & Personal**
- **Modern, clean interface** - No cluttered menus or confusing options
- **Light and dark themes** - Matches your system preferences automatically
- **Customize everything** - Want pink buttons? Go for it! Real-time CSS editing included
- **Minimalist design** - Stays out of your way while you work

### ‚ö° **Just Works**
- **Global hotkey** - Press `Ctrl+Alt+M` anywhere to toggle sounds on/off
- **Lives in your system tray** - No desktop clutter, just pure functionality
- **Starts with Windows** - Set it and forget it
- **Instant soundpack switching** - No restarts needed, just click and go

### üéÅ **Smart Features That Care**

- **Import soundpacks easily** - Drag & drop, no file copying required
- **Works with old soundpacks** - Your existing collections are automatically updated

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Quick Install
1. **Download** the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes-dx/releases)
2. **Run the installer** or extract the portable version
3. **Launch** - It might ask for admin permissions (needed for global hotkeys)
4. **Pick your sounds** - Choose keyboard and mouse soundpacks
5. **Start typing** - Enjoy the satisfying clicks!

> **Note**: Admin permissions help MechvibesDX capture keystrokes globally - it's totally safe and only used for sound triggering!

### Your First 5 Minutes
1. **Choose your vibe** - Pick a soundpack that matches your mood
2. **Adjust volumes** - Make it just right for your environment
3. **Try the hotkey** - Press `Ctrl+Alt+M` to toggle sounds on/off
4. **Minimize to tray** - Let it live quietly in your system tray
5. **Enjoy typing** - Every keystroke now has character!

## Soundpacks - The Heart & Soul üéµ

Think of soundpacks as different "keyboard personalities" you can switch between. Want the deep thock of a premium keyboard? There's a soundpack for that. Prefer crisp, clicky sounds? Got you covered.

### What's Included
I've curated several high-quality soundpacks to get you started:
- **Cherry MX varieties** - Classic mechanical switch sounds
- **Custom creations** - Unique soundscapes I've crafted
- **Community favorites** - Popular sounds from the mechanical keyboard community

### Making It Yours
- **Import soundpacks** - Just drag and drop new soundpack folders
- **No complicated setup** - MechvibesDX figures out the rest
- **Instant switching** - Try different sounds without restarting
- **Volume tweaking** - Make each soundpack perfect for your space

### Want to Create Your Own?
I've made it super simple! Just:
1. **Record or find audio** - OGG, WAV, or MP3 files work great
2. **Create a simple config** - JSON file that maps keys to sound segments
3. **Drop it in** - MechvibesDX will auto-detect and validate it
4. **Share with friends** - Spread the mechanical keyboard love!

Example soundpack structure:
```
My Cool Soundpack/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json    # Simple key mappings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sounds.ogg     # Your audio file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ icon.png       # Optional: Custom icon
```

## Customization - Make It Yours üé®

### Themes That Match Your Mood
- **Auto dark/light** - Follows your system theme
- **Custom CSS editor** - Go wild with colors and styles
- **Live preview** - See changes as you type
- **Save your work** - Themes persist between sessions

### Personal Touches
Want to make MechvibesDX truly yours? The built-in CSS editor lets you:
- Change colors to match your setup
- Adjust button styles and layouts
- Create custom animations
- Make it as subtle or flashy as you want

```css
/* Example: Make everything purple because why not? */
:root {
  --primary: #8b5cf6;
  --accent: #a855f7;
}
```

## Behind the Scenes (The Fun Stuff) üîß

### How It Works
MechvibesDX listens to your keyboard and mouse activity, then plays perfectly timed sounds. It's like having a sound engineer following you around, but way less creepy and much more useful.

### Performance
- **Lightweight** - Won't slow down your computer
- **Fast startup** - Ready to go in seconds
- **Smart resource usage** - Only uses power when making sounds
- **No audio lag** - Sounds play instantly with your keystrokes

### Privacy & Security
- **Runs locally** - No data sent anywhere
- **Open source** - You can see exactly what it does
- **Admin permissions** - Only for global hotkey functionality
- **Your data stays yours** - Soundpacks and settings live on your machine

## Troubleshooting - When Things Go Wonky üîß

### Common "Oops" Moments

**No sounds playing?**
- Check if sounds are muted (try `Ctrl+Alt+M`)
- Make sure a soundpack is selected
- Verify your system volume isn't muted

**Hotkey not working?**
- Try running as administrator
- Check if another app is using the same hotkey
- Restart MechvibesDX

**Soundpack won't load?**
- Check the config.json file for typos
- Make sure audio files are in supported formats
- Try re-importing the soundpack

**App feels sluggish?**
- Close other audio applications
- Restart MechvibesDX
- Check if your audio drivers need updating
