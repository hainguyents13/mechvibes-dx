/// minimized window, so nothing appears and the app is never activated. The

///
/// The `set_focus()` below is not what raises the window on Linux or Windows:
/// it runs while `set_visible(true)` is still only queued for tao's event loop,
/// and tao drops a focus request for a window it has not shown yet. The focus is
/// asked for again, once the window reports itself visible, in the loop that
