//! Windows Raw Input capture - runs in the **input worker process**
//! (`input_worker.rs`), never in the UI process.
//!
//! Delivers `WM_INPUT` to a hidden window registered with `RIDEV_INPUTSINK`
//! so keyboard/mouse events arrive regardless of which window has focus -
//! the fix for "no sound while the app itself is focused" on Windows.
//!
//! Why a separate process: Windows allows only ONE Raw Input target window
//! per device class per process, and tao/wry registers keyboard+mouse raw
//! input for its own window once the Dioxus UI is built, overwriting any
//! registration we make in that process. Verified empirically in Phase 4:
//! immediately after startup the registration points at our HWND with
//! `RIDEV_INPUTSINK` (flags=0x100); ~5s later (UI up) it points at tao's
//! HWND with flags=0, and our message loop then receives zero messages -
//! not just zero `WM_INPUT`, zero messages of any kind. The limit is
//! per-process, so a worker process with no webview in it is unaffected.
//!
//! Two findings from that debugging worth keeping:
//!   1. A message-only (`HWND_MESSAGE`) window NEVER receives `WM_INPUT`,
//!      even though `RegisterRawInputDevices` reports success. Must be a
//!      normal window that simply is never shown.
//!   2. Running the listener on a spawned thread is fine - the message loop
//!      does not have to be on the process's main thread.
//!
//! Windows-only. macOS/Linux keep using `input_listener.rs` +
//! `focused_input_listener.rs` (rdev/device_query/evdev), unaffected by
//! this file.

/// When another process registers a no-modifier hotkey (Rainmeter binding

/// the KEY-UP. Since every sound downstream is played on the down
/// transition, such a key was completely silent. An up with no recorded
/// down is therefore evidence that the down was swallowed, and synthesizing
/// it is what restores the sound.
///
/// ## Why this cannot double-fire on legitimately filtered input
///
/// This runs in the worker process at the very top of the pipeline, before
/// either filter that can drop a down:
///
/// 1. `pressed_keys` (here) - sees every raw event, filters nothing.
/// 2. `input_worker.rs::is_physical_keyboard_event` - drops NULL-hDevice
///    (injected/IME) events on their way to the pipe.
/// 3. `input_worker_host.rs::wire_for_event` - drops events from devices the
///    user disabled in Settings.
///
/// Because both filters sit *downstream*, a down they drop was still
/// recorded here first. Its matching up therefore finds the code present and
/// classifies as a plain `Up`, never `OrphanUp` - so a filtered source emits
/// no synthesized down. Only a down that never reached this layer at all,
/// which is exactly the hotkey case, produces one.
///
/// ## Auto-repeat
///
/// Holding a claimed key makes Windows swallow every repeated down and send
/// a single up at the end, so the user hears one sound per press-release
/// cycle rather than a repeat stream. Accepted: one sound is the fix's whole
