//! Input worker process entry point (Windows only).
//!
//! The same executable, launched with `--input-worker`, runs this instead
//! of the Dioxus UI. It owns the Raw Input registration (`rawinput_listener`)
//! and streams every key/button transition to its parent over stdout, one
//! line per event.
//!
//! It exists as a separate process because Windows only allows one Raw Input
//! target window per device class per process, and tao/wry claims that slot
//! in the UI process - see `rawinput_listener.rs` module docs. This process
//! never builds a webview, so nothing competes for the registration.
//!
//! ## Wire format (worker -> host, one line per event)
//!
//! ```text
//! K\t{device_id}\t{code}\t{down|up}    keyboard
//! M\t{device_id}\t{code}\t{down|up}    mouse
//! ```
//!
//! `device_id` is the hash `InputDeviceManager` computes for that physical
//! device, or `-` when the lookup failed. `code` is the same string the
//! rdev/evdev listeners produce (`"KeyA"`, `"MouseLeft"`), so the audio
//! engine's parser is untouched. Text rather than a binary encoding so the
//! stream can be read by eye when debugging: run the worker from a terminal
//! and watch the lines.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT done here: device filtering and hotkey detection. Config
//! lives in the UI process; keeping the only copy there avoids syncing it
//! across the pipe (see `input_worker_host.rs`).
//!
//! ## Lifetime
//!
//! The worker exits when its stdin reaches EOF, which Windows delivers as
//! soon as the parent's pipe handle closes - on clean exit *and* on crash.
//! That is the whole orphan-prevention mechanism; no Job Object needed.
